## Usage

### How to take a todo

Simple as that:

    TODO: write a better usage! #p1

__#p1__ = priority 1

By default, ReviewMyself only supports priority number from 1 to 3. I don't think we need more than that, but it depend on you, take a look at Customize.

### Get a bird's view on the project

What's a bird's view ? Some thing like that:

There are 2 ways to do that:

- Ctrl + Shift + P, then type and enter __ReviewMyself: Folders in Project__
- Right click on a file/folder in side bar => choose __ReviewMyself__

## Customize

The settings are self-documenting, so just go to Preferences -> Packages Settings -> ReviewMyself, and tweak it.
