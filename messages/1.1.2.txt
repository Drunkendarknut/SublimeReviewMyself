* add missing in-source license information

Sorry to @jonathandelgado, who developed TodoReview plugin.
I thought that writing reference information in README was enought.

It's my bad!
You can see that I respected sources which I referred from (include yours) by writing them in README,
moreover I even did not write any my author-related information in my sources.

Those above things, I hope, proved that I respect your work, also the authors of SublimeTODO (which TodoReview is forked from).

I forked from yours and developed this plugin myself because I need some features to serve my work.
When looking for your repository at Github, I seen that you didn't commit any change from 3 months ago.
So I thought that your plugin was discontinued.

Again, I'm sorry. Hope you accept my apology and allow me contribute TodoReview with you.
Thanks for reading!
