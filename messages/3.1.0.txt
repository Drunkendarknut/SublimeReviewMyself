+ add specific folder setting feature

Thanks to @isyara suggested this feature:
	https://github.com/thenewvu/SublimeReviewMyself/issues/2

This feature allows you tell Review Myself only track some file or dir in your project folder.

For example, assume that your project has this structure:

foo/
	inner_1/
		inner_1_1/
			file.py
			file1.py
			file2.py
		inner_1_2/
	inner_2/
	inner_3/

You only want to track todos in 'inner_1_1' folder, put '.local.reviewmyself' file in 'foo' folder, and tweak it:

{
	"only_care_paths": ["inner_1/innner_1_1"]
}

Note: 'Only care paths' must be relative paths.
